### coming to you daily until i give up.

<b>log day 1:<br></b>

this is giving me the opportunity to become more familiar with .gitignore,<br>
using virtual environments, and honing into my IDE preference. currently <br>
finding jupyter notebook hosted locally, installed via terminal with pip<br>
on top of a venv to be the best methodology. it has code completion with<br>
tab, and "lookup" of embedded help menus for scripts with shift-tab. tried<br>
to not install numpy this go around. ðŸ˜„
