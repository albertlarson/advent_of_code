# Advent of Code 2022

### coming to you daily until i give up.

i remember from last year that i created many elif statements. <br>
this problem reminded me of that, but i also recalled how <br>
python 3.10 introduced structural pattern matching. i've never<br>
used the technique before, so figured it was worth giving a try.<br>
i found that i didn't have 3.10 installed on my local machine,<br>
so i went and installed with brew. i found that because i already<br>
had python3 alias allocated, brew made python3.10 and pip3.10 the<br>
hyperlinks. i updated my .zconfig accordingly. i also installed<br>
jupyterthemes and used the onedork theme.<br>

there's probably a better, more programmatic way to tally up the <br>
scores for the two problems, but i am trying to solve the problems<br>
and sometimes it's less cumbersome to be too highfalutin with the code.<br>

this is giving me the opportunity to become more familiar with .gitignore,<br>
using virtual environments, and honing into my IDE preference. currently <br>
finding jupyter notebook hosted locally, installed via terminal with pip<br>
on top of a venv to be the best methodology. it has code completion with<br>
tab, and "lookup" of embedded help menus for scripts with shift-tab. tried<br>
to not install numpy this go around. ðŸ˜„
